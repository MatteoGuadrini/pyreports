Reports
#######

The package comes with a **Report** object and a **ReportBook** object.

The *Report* object provides an interface for a complete workflow-based report (see :ref:`workflow`).

The *ReportBook* object, on the other hand, is a list of *Report* objects.

This will follow the workflows of each *Report* it contains, except for the output, which can be saved in a single Excel file.
