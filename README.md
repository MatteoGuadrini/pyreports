# reports

_reports_ is a python library that allows you to create complex reports from various sources such as databases, 
text files, ldap, etc. and perform processing, filters, counters, etc. 
and then export or write them in various formats or in databases.

> Project status: **alpha released**

## How does it work

_reports_ wants to be a library that simplifies the collection of data from multiple sources such as databases, 
files and directory servers (through LDAP), the processing of them through built-in and customized functions, 
and the saving in various formats (or, by inserting the data in a database).

_reports_ uses the [**tablib**](https://tablib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to organize the data into _Dataset_ object.

### Simple report

```python
import reports

# Select source: this is a DatabaseManager object
mydb = reports.manager('mysql', host='mysql1.local', database='login_users', username='dba', password='dba0000')

# Get data
mydb.execute('SELECT * FROM site_login')
site_login = mydb.fetchall()

# Filter data
error_login = reports.Executor(site_login)
error_login.filter([400, 401, 403, 404])

# Save report: this is a FileManager object
output = reports.manager('csv', '/home/report/error_login.csv', mode='w')
output.write(error_login)

```

## Open source
_reports_ is an open source project. Any contribute, It's welcome.
