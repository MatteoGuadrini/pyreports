# reports

_reports_ is a python library that allows you to create complex reports from various sources such as databases, 
text files, ldap, etc. and perform processing, filters, counters, etc. 
and then export or write them in various formats or in databases.

> Project status: **beta released**

## Test package

To test the package, follow these instructions:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/reports.git
$ cd reports
$ python -m unittest discover tests
```

## How does it work

_reports_ wants to be a library that simplifies the collection of data from multiple sources such as databases, 
files and directory servers (through LDAP), the processing of them through built-in and customized functions, 
and the saving in various formats (or, by inserting the data in a database).

_reports_ uses the [**tablib**](https://tablib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library to organize the data into _Dataset_ object.

### Simple report

I take the data from a database table, filter the data I need and save it in a csv file

```python
import reports

# Select source: this is a DatabaseManager object
mydb = reports.manager('mysql', host='mysql1.local', database='login_users', username='dba', password='dba0000')

# Get data
mydb.execute('SELECT * FROM site_login')
site_login = mydb.fetchall()

# Filter data
error_login = reports.Executor(site_login)
error_login.filter([400, 401, 403, 404, 500])

# Save report: this is a FileManager object
output = reports.manager('csv', '/home/report/error_login.csv')
output.write(error_login.get_data())

```

### Combine source

I take the data from a database table and a log file and save the report in json format

```python
import reports

# Select source: this is a DatabaseManager object
mydb = reports.manager('mysql', host='mysql1.local', database='login_users', username='dba', password='dba0000')
# Select another source: this is a FileManager object
mylog = reports.manager('file', '/var/log/httpd/error.log')

# Get data
mydb.execute('SELECT * FROM site_login')
site_login = mydb.fetchall()
error_log = mylog.read()

# Filter database
error_login = reports.Executor(site_login)
error_login.filter([400, 401, 403, 404, 500])
users_in_error = set(error_login.select_column('users'))

# Prepare log
myreport = dict()
log_user_error = reports.Executor(error_log)
log_user_error.filter(list(users_in_error))
for line in log_user_error:
    for user in users_in_error:
        myreport.setdefault(user, [])
        myreport[user].append(line)

# Save report: this is a FileManager object
output = reports.manager('json', '/home/report/error_login.json')
output.write(myreport)

```

### Report object

```python
import reports

# Select source: this is a DatabaseManager object
mydb = reports.manager('mysql', host='mysql1.local', database='login_users', username='dba', password='dba0000')
output = reports.manager('xlsx', '/home/report/error_login.xlsx', mode='w')

# Get data
mydb.execute('SELECT * FROM site_login')
site_login = mydb.fetchall()

# Create report data
report = reports.Report(site_login, title='Site login failed', filters=[400, 401, 403, 404, 500], output=output)
# Filter data
report.exec()
# Save data on file
report.export()

```
